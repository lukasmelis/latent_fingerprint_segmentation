This repository was created within the bachelor thesis. Our target was to create segmentation tool for latent fingerprints.
This repository contains:
- **modules/** -- python scripts for segmentation by K-Means and Mask R-CNN. It also contains script for computing masks IoU and script for visualization.
- **desing/**  -- .ui files for GUI app
- **segmentation_tool.py** -- our GUI controller
- **mrcnn_latent/** -- implementation of Mask R-CNN

In directory mrcnn_latent are missing training weights, because of 100 MB github limit. In case you want them, write on my email: lukasomeli@gmail.com
